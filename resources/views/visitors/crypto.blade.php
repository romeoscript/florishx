                        banks or any other financial institution. Cryptocurrencies are
                        highly volatile and can be profitable to any trader’s portfolio.
Cryptocurrencies are not physical coins they are electronic, a digital asset that remains as data.
The technology behind the cryptocurrency controls a large part of its value which holds new technology on
the secure way to identify and transfer money.
The first digital coin introduced was the Bitcoin and today it remains as the standard that all other coins
compare themselves to. Following in its steps came Litecoin, so to date they stand as the top 2 highly
valued coins on the market. There are several other coins also reaching a high-level market share such as
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ripple, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
